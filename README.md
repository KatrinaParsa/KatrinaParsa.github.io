# About Me

![pic](01ebf279-cc41-4326-9fcb-e54b53efd74f.JPG)

I from NY and I am a freshman at Lehigh. I am going to major in chemistry, because it interests me a lot. I look foward to getting involved in research projects with professors. In these research projects I can apply my knowledge in real life applications. I have always had a love for learning new things, and to explore topics outside of my interests. This makes for a more well rounded education, which I value greatly. I am also in various clubs on campus, which is can explore my passions outside the classroom. Outside the classroom, in my free time I love to play tennis. It is my favorite sport, and I intend on joining the tennis club to meet people new people.

# Lehigh Enrollment

 Lehigh is strong is academics in all disciplines, but they're well known for their top engineering programs. Here we see that majority of students are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering. There is a relativity even distribution of men and women that enroll, and more men happen to go towards the College of Engineering. This was collected by the [Office of Insitiutional Research and Statistic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf)

Lehigh is best known for the well rounded liberal arts education and exceptional engineering program. There has always been a large enrollment into the engineering program to where that college has the largest enrollment. However, from 2016 there has been a gradual increase of enrollment into the College of Arts and Sciences. More applicants are looking at Lehigh as an overall school rather than an engineering institution, which is what probably lead to the increase in arts and science students.

# Biomedical Enhancements

Scientists have gotten very far in scientific advancements, to a point where we have discovered more than we need, which is great because it allows for improvement and efficiency in many fields. However, technology will get to a point where we have to put limits to its capabilites. The more scientists delve into these types of research, the more science ends up overlooking the ethics of humanity. For example, in the medical field we have the ability to alter genes in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of certain diseases. That same method could be used to alter ascepts in someone's genome that is unescessary, and many people view that as interfering with human nature. Majority of people opposethe idea of implementing these on humans. Furthermore, many believe that these technologies are going too far, despite having benefical intention. From the data we see that people are resistance to biomedical technologies for several reasons, some of which has to do with religion, education, and income. Most devot people tend to stick with their personal beliefs, which is expected since those ideas are important to them, and others are resistant due to their lack of understanding of these procedures. Most people with a college degree or higher and/or a higher yearly income believe that the current elective procedures are appropriate to perform, which is why they are open to new advancements. These advancements are beneficial, but it need to be managed not to be used in an unethical manner.  

This data was collected by Pew Research [click here](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/07/PS_2016.07.26_Human-Enhancement-Survey_FINAL.pdf) to find out more.

# Trust In Science

There will be a need for new scientific research. Even though science has allowed us to understand the world better, which has benefited our exsistance, there are many people who are skeptical about scientific advancements. People with a high school diploma or less are more likely to disregard any developements as important.  The root of this problem is mostly because people who don't understand science well have a hard time trusting it or noting its significance.

# Streaming Services
TV has changed over the years due to the growing streaming services like Netflix, Home Box Office, Hulu, and more. These platforms are used, because of their wide variety of classic shows ans each streaming services' original shows, like many "Netlfix originals." Hulu and Netflix have had growing success over the past six years, especially Netflix because they started out much earlier than other streaming platforms. Due to the success and convience of these services cable tv will eventually become obsolete.

# Wealth Across the States

There has always been an issue witht the distribution of wealth in America. The majority of the wealth is clustered together instead of being spread out amoung the millions of Americans. The top 10 percent of households hold most of the wealth, leaving the botton 90 percent with only 40 percent of the wealth. In the map below each state is ranked from how much wealth they have, and what percent of households make over $200,000 for their yearly income. New York, Massachusetts, Delaware, Connecticut, and California are amoung the top five states that hold the most wealth. This is probably due to the fact that these states have a larger population, and because they have major cities within them. Therefore, it makes sense that New York is ranked first, because of the multitudes of ways they accumulate revenue in New York City alone. In terms of household income, Washington DC is ranked first. This is probably because of the amount of political officials there, who tend to make more than others. If you look closer, you will see that New York and Massachusetts are also ranked farther up compared to other states. With this in mind you start to think about the relationship between the population of a state to its overall wealth distribution.
