# About Me

I from NY and I am a freshman at Lehigh. I am going to major in chemistry, because it interests me a lot. I look foward to getting involved in research projects with professors. I am also in various clubs on campus, this allows me to explore my passions outside the classroom. In my free time I love to play tennis, and I intend on joining the tennis club to meet people new people.
