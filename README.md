I from NY and I am a freshman at Lehigh. I am going to major in chemistry, because it interests me a lot. I look foward to getting involved in research projects with professors. In these research projects I can apply my knowledge in real life applications. I have always had a love for learning new things, and to explore topics outside of my interests. This makes for a more well rounded education, which I value greatly. I am also in various clubs on campus, which is can explore my passions outside the classroom. Outside the classroom, in my free time I love to play tennis. It is my favorite sport, and I intend on joining the tennis club to meet people new people.
