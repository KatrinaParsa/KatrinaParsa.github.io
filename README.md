# About Me

![pic](01ebf279-cc41-4326-9fcb-e54b53efd74f.JPG)

I from NY and I am a freshman at Lehigh. I am going to major in chemistry, because it interests me a lot. I look foward to getting involved in research projects with professors. In these research projects I can apply my knowledge in real life applications. I have always had a love for learning new things, and to explore topics outside of my interests. This makes for a more well rounded education, which I value greatly. I am also in various clubs on campus, which is can explore my passions outside the classroom. Outside the classroom, in my free time I love to play tennis. It is my favorite sport, and I intend on joining the tennis club to meet people new people.

# Lehigh Enrollment

 Lehigh is strong is academics in all disciplines, but they're well known for their top engineering programs. Here we see that majority of students are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering. There is a relativity even distribution of men and women that enroll, and more men happen to go towards the College of Engineering. This was collected by the [Office of Insitiutional Research and Statistic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf)

# Biomedical Enhancements

Scientists have gotten very far in scientific advancements, to a point where we have discovered more than we need, which is great because it allows for improvement and efficiency in many fields. However, technology will get to a point where we have to put limits to its capabilites. The more scientists delve into these types of research, the more science ends up overlooking the ethics of humanity. For example, in the medical field we have the ability to alter genes in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of certain diseases. That same method could be used to alter ascepts in someone's genome that is unescessary, and many people view that as interfering with human nature. Majority of people opposethe idea of implementing these on humans. Furthermore, many believe that these technologies are going too far, despite having benefical intention. From the data we see that people are resistance to biomedical technologies for several reasons, some of which has to do with religion, education, and income. Most devot people tend to stick with their personal beliefs, which is expected since those ideas are important to them, and others are resistant due to their lack of understanding of these procedures. Most people with a college degree or higher and/or a higher yearly income believe that the current elective procedures are appropriate to perform, which is why they are open to new advancements. These advancements are beneficial, but it need to be managed not to be used in an unethical manner.  

This data was collected by Pew Research [click here](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/07/PS_2016.07.26_Human-Enhancement-Survey_FINAL.pdf) to find out more.
